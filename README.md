I just got my motorbike driving license so i thought I would make a game to hone my skills before I buy the real stuff.

To make this game I used the sdl library (https://wiki.libsdl.org/) and the go bindings for it (https://github.com/veandco/go-sdl2).
Just installing the go bindings with go get or a package manager like dep is not sufficient, you also have to get the actual sdl libraries in C as explained in the go-sdl2 repo.

The package manager I used is dep.

## How to run it ? 
I compiled a version for Linux based systems in the repo ( maybe works on mac as well).
For other systems, get the required packages by the means you are used to and cd in the main folder and type 
```
go run main.go
```

I definitely recommend reading Joe Bar Team comic books for all french speakers out there :D
